# AndroidStackOverflow-Web-site
This is web site that extracts (backend) and displays recent/most voted Stack Overflow Android related questions.

### Problematic:
We want a simple way to go through the recent Android programming questions on Stack Overflow with the intention of answering them. 

### Solution: 

The solution proposed is a web site that provides the following:
  
  1- Collection of information about most recent Android questions, aswell as most voted questions.
  
  2- Possibility to view the questions, and be directed to answer it on Stack Overflow. 
  
  3- Bonus: The registered users are able to receive emails each time a new question is asked. 
    (This feature might cause receiving a lot of emails. Although, it can be improved to only send questions
     notifications depending of preferences of the user and answering history, although due to time constraints I kept it as simple as possible for now.)
     
 
 ### Realization of the website:

##### Tools: 

I chosed to use Django framework to build this website, this is probably a good time for you to install the last version of django via the following command: 

''' pip install django '''
